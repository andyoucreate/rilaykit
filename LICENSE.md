# RilayKit Licensing

RilayKit uses a dual licensing model to support both open source and commercial use cases.

## 📦 Package Licenses

### Free & Open Source (MIT License)

The following packages are free to use for any purpose, including commercial use:

- **`@rilaykit/core`** - Core functionality and types
- **`@rilaykit/forms`** - Form building utilities and components

These packages are licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which means you can:
- ✅ Use for any purpose (personal, commercial, etc.)
- ✅ Modify and distribute
- ✅ Include in proprietary software
- ✅ Sell products that use these packages

### Commercial License Required

The following package requires a commercial license for ALL use:

- **`@rilaykit/workflow`** - Advanced workflow and multi-step form utilities

⚠️ **Important:** This package is NEVER free. It requires a paid license for any use case, including:
- 🏢 **Commercial applications** - Business websites and applications
- 🎓 **Educational use** - Students, teachers, academic research
- 🏠 **Personal projects** - Side projects and hobby applications
- 🧪 **Development and testing** - All development environments

**Without a valid license, the package will display watermarks in the UI and console that cannot be removed.**
