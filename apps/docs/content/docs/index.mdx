# Welcome to RilayKit

**RilayKit** is a next-generation React form library that combines powerful functionality with exceptional developer experience. Built with TypeScript-first design, it provides type-safe form building through an intuitive fluent API while maintaining complete UI flexibility.

<Callout type="info">
RilayKit follows a **headless architecture** — you bring the components, we handle the complex logic, state management, and validation.
</Callout>

## Why Choose RilayKit?

- **🎯 Type-Safe by Design**: Full TypeScript support with intelligent type inference
- **🧩 Modular Architecture**: Use only what you need — core, forms, workflows, or validation adapters
- **⚡ Fluent Builder API**: Intuitive, chainable syntax for building complex forms
- **🎨 UI Agnostic**: Works with any component library (Material-UI, Chakra, Ant Design, or custom)
- **🔄 Advanced Workflows**: Multi-step processes with conditional logic and persistence
- **📊 Built-in Analytics**: Track user behavior and form performance (Premium)

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { ril } from '@rilaykit/core';
import { Form, FormField } from '@rilaykit/forms';

// Configure your instance once
const rilay = ril.create()
  .addComponent('input', { renderer: YourInputComponent });

// Build forms with fluent API
const loginForm = rilay
  .form('login')
  .add({ id: 'email', type: 'input', validation: [required(), email()] })
  .add({ id: 'password', type: 'input', validation: [required(), minLength(8)] });

// Render anywhere
<Form formConfig={loginForm} onSubmit={handleLogin}>
  <FormField fieldId="email" />
  <FormField fieldId="password" />
</Form>
```

## Architecture Overview

RilayKit's modular design allows you to compose exactly the functionality you need:

## Core Principles

### 🏗️ **Bring Your Own Components**
RilayKit doesn't include UI components. Instead, it connects to your existing components through a powerful renderer system. This means:
- Perfect integration with your design system
- No CSS conflicts or unwanted styling
- Complete control over accessibility and UX

### 🔧 **Extensible by Design**
Every aspect of RilayKit can be customized:
- Custom validators and validation logic
- Conditional field visibility and behavior
- Custom renderers for any UI framework
- Plugin system for extending functionality

### 🛡️ **Type Safety First**
Built from the ground up with TypeScript:
- Intelligent autocompletion for your registered components
- Compile-time validation of form configurations
- Inferred types from validation schemas
- Zero runtime type errors
