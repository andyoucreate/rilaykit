import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The `@rilaykit/workflow` package is commercial software. A valid license key is required to use it in a production environment and to remove the "Trial Use Only" watermark.

Development environments (like `localhost`) do not require a license and will not display a watermark.

## Activating Your License

To activate your license, you need to call `RilayLicenseManager.setLicenseKey()` once when your application starts. A good place for this is in a root layout file or a central providers file.

The license key should be stored securely, ideally as an environment variable.

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx or providers.tsx"
import { RilayLicenseManager } from '@rilaykit/workflow';

// The key is safe to be exposed on the client-side
RilayLicenseManager.setLicenseKey(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_RILAY_LICENSE_KEY);
```

<Callout>
The license key is safe to be exposed on the client-side. It is cryptographically signed using an Ed25519 signature and cannot be tampered with. The validation happens securely within the component.
</Callout>

## How It Works

- The `RilayLicenseManager` validates the license key against a public key.
- It checks the signature, expiry date, and other license details.
- If the license is invalid or expired, the validation will fail, and the watermark will be displayed in production.
- In development mode, console warnings will appear if the license is missing or invalid, but the watermark is suppressed to not interfere with development.

## Obtaining a License

You can purchase a license key from the official Rilaykit website. Various plans are available to suit different needs.

## License Status API

You can programmatically check the status of the license. This can be useful for displaying messages to administrators or for debugging.

```tsx
import { RilayLicenseManager } from '@rilaykit/workflow';

// Get the raw validation result
const licenseResult = RilayLicenseManager.getLicenseResult();
/*
{
  valid: boolean,
  error?: 'MISSING' | 'EXPIRED' | 'INVALID' | 'SIGNATURE_INVALID' | 'FORMAT_INVALID',
  data?: {
    plan: 'ARCHITECT' | 'FOUNDRY',
    company: string,
    expiry: number,
    ...
  }
}
*/

// Check if the watermark should be shown
const shouldShowWatermark = RilayLicenseManager.shouldDisplayWatermark();

// Get license info in a friendly format
const info = await RilayLicenseManager.getLicenseInfo();
/*
{
  plan: 'FOUNDRY',
  company: 'ACME Inc.',
  expiryDate: '12/25/2024'
}
*/
```
This allows you to build custom logic around your license status if needed.
